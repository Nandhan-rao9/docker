## 🐳 Visitor App
A simple Flask + Redis application running in Docker.

📦 Prerequisites
Linux VM (e.g., EC2)

Docker

Git

🚀 Setup Instructions
1. Log into VM & Install Dependencies
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo yum install -y git

2. Clone the Repository
git clone <this-git-repo-link>
cd <repo-name>

3. Configure Docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

⚠️ Important: Log out and log back in after adding your user to the docker group for the changes to take effect.

4. Build Docker Image
docker build -t visitor-app .

5. Create Docker Network
A dedicated network allows the containers to communicate with each other.

docker network create visitor-net

6. Run Containers
Start Redis

This command starts the Redis container in detached mode (-d), names it redis, and attaches it to our created network.

docker run -d --name redis --network visitor-net redis:alpine

Start Flask App

This command starts the Flask web application, connects it to the same network, and maps port 5000 on the host to port 5000 in the container.

docker run -d --name web-app --network visitor-net -p 5000:5000 visitor-app

7. Verify Containers
Check that both containers are running successfully.

docker ps

🌍 Access the App
You can now access the application by navigating to your VM's public IP address on port 5000.
