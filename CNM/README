Nice start 👍 That looks like the beginning of a **README.md** instruction guide.
I’ll polish it into proper Markdown with consistent formatting, headings, and code blocks so it looks professional on GitHub:

# 🚀 Project Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your VM.

---

## 🔹 1. Log into VM
```bash
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo yum install git -y
````

---

## 🔹 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <this-git-repo-link>
cd <repo-name>
```

---

## 🔹 3. Configure Docker on VM

```bash
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

> ⚠️ After adding your user to the `docker` group, **log out and log back in** for the changes to take effect.

---

## 🔹 4. Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t app-name .
```

---

## 🔹 5. Setup Docker Network

```bash
docker network create visitor-net
```

---

## 🔹 6. Run Containers

Start Redis:

```bash
docker run -d --name redis --network visitor-net redis:alpine
```

Start Flask App:

```bash
docker run -d --name web-app --network visitor-net -p 5000:5000 visitor-app
```

---

## 🔹 7. Verify Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

---

✅ Your Flask app should now be available at:

```
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:5000
```

```

---

Would you like me to also add a **section with `docker-compose.yml`** so you can start Redis + Flask in one command instead of typing all these manually?
